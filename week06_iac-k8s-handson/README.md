# 📘 Week 6 – IaC Progress + AWS Practitioner Advancement  
### *Terraform Foundations + AWS Essentials — Transition Week*

Week 6 was a transitional and consolidation-focused week.  
After some disruptions at the end of Week 5 (birthday + sick day), Week 6 centered on:

- Regaining momentum in Terraform  
- Installing and configuring Terraform locally  
- Completing AWS Cloud Practitioner Module 11  
- Strengthening fundamentals before beginning full Kubernetes + IaC hands-on work in Week 7

Hands-on Kubernetes and Terraform projects (Deployments, Services, local IaC projects) will officially start in **Week 7**.
