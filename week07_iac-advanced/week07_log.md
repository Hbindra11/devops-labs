## 📘 Daily Log

---

### 📆 Day 1 — (Nov 22)
**What I worked on:**  
- Completed the **Hello Minikube** tutorial from the Kubernetes website.

**Notes / Challenges:**  
- The tutorial ran successfully, but it wasn’t entirely clear what learning objective it served beyond verifying that Minikube was installed and working.  
- Felt unsure how it connected to deeper Kubernetes concepts.

**Next steps:**  
- Begin creating YAML manifests manually using `kubectl --dry-run` and organize them in a local practice folder.

---

### 📆 Day 2 — (Nov 23)
**What I worked on:**  
- No study completed.

**Notes / Challenges:**  
- Family responsibilities and weekend activities made it difficult to focus or find study time.  
- Needed to reset expectations for the rest of the week.

**Next steps:**  
- Resume planned hands-on practice with Minikube on the following day.

---

### 📆 Day 3 — (Nov 24)
**What I worked on:**  
- Spent most of the day working on a **new job application**.

**Notes / Challenges:**  
- Application took far more time than expected.  
- No remaining energy for technical learning afterward.

**Next steps:**  
- Return to the Kubernetes hands-on plan on Day 4.

---

### 📆 Day 4 — (Nov 25)
**What I worked on:**  
- Followed the revised Week 7 plan and completed a focused **30-minute Minikube hands-on session**.  
- Created a new local practice folder for Kubernetes manifests.  
- Generated YAML for **Pod, Deployment, and Service** using:  
  `--dry-run=client -o yaml > file.yaml`  
- Applied all resources, verified them, and viewed the **Nginx application running in the browser**.  
- Cleaned up by deleting all objects afterward.

**Notes / Challenges:**  
- First time generating manifests using dry-run — very helpful for understanding YAML structure.  
- Successfully confirmed the workflow: create → apply → test → delete.

**Next steps:**  
- Move on to Terraform hands-on practice next.

---

### 📆 Day 5 — (Nov 26)
**What I worked on:**  
- Worked on another job application earlier in the day.  
- In the evening, completed **hands-on Terraform practice**.  
- Created a Terraform project folder with:
  - `main.tf` (local + random providers)
  - `variables.tf` (default filename variable)
  - `outputs.tf` (random name + file path)
  - `terraform.tfvars` (override filename)
- Ran the full Terraform workflow:  
  `terraform init → validate → plan → apply → destroy`

**Notes / Challenges:**  
- Understood variable precedence more clearly after observing how `terraform.tfvars` overrides defaults.  
- Good hands-on reinforcement of provider configuration and resource relationships.

**Next steps:**  
- Continue the KodeKloud Terraform course, especially upcoming sections on **state files** and **backends**.

---

### 📆 Day 6 — (Nov 27)
**What I worked on:**  
- Continuing Terraform learning and refining understanding of providers, variables, and outputs.  
- Planning to begin the next KodeKloud Terraform lessons on **state**, **backends**, and more advanced configuration examples.

**Notes / Challenges:**  
- Balancing study time with job applications and other responsibilities.

**Next steps:**  
- Complete next Terraform modules (state management).  
- Prepare Week 8 plan focusing on continued Terraform + Kubernetes practice.
