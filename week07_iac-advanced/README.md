# 📘 Week 7 – Advanced IaC + Kubernetes Hands-On  
### *Terraform Projects + Minikube Deployments + AWS Practitioner Final Stretch*

Week 7 builds directly on the foundations established during Weeks 5 and 6.  
With Terraform installed locally and Minikube prepared, this week focuses on **practical, hands-on DevOps engineering workflows**:

- Creating real Terraform project files  
- Deploying workloads to Minikube  
- Applying Infrastructure as Code (IaC) concepts to AWS  
- Finishing the remaining AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials modules  

This week marks the start of “real” DevOps lab work — creating files, committing resources to the repo, and integrating multiple tools.

  - Resources  
  - Outputs  
  - State management  
- Build a small, real Terraform project such as:
  - S3 bucket (safe/free)
  - IAM user (with no permissions)
  - EC2 (optional — only if comfortable)

### 🔹 Kubernetes – Minikube Practical Labs

- Create YAML manifests for:
  - Pod
  - Deployment
  - Service (ClusterIP / NodePort)
- Deploy workloads using `kubectl apply -f`
- Explore:
  - Logs
  - Scaling
  - Rollouts & rollbacks
- Access the application locally
