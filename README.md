# 🚀 DevOps & Cloud Learning Portfolio  

This repository documents my **8-week self-directed upskilling plan** in **DevOps and Cloud Engineering**, combining study, guided practice, and continuous hands-on learning.  
It demonstrates my practical progression through CI/CD, containerization, cloud infrastructure, and automation — supported by structured weekly goals and real lab projects.

---

## 🧭 Overview

The labs and projects in this repo are designed to build a solid foundation across key DevOps domains:

- **CI/CD Pipelines** – GitHub Actions, Jenkins (learning)  
- **Containers** – Docker, Docker Compose  
- **Orchestration** – Kubernetes (Minikube, KodeKloud)  
- **Cloud Platforms** – AWS (EC2, S3, IAM, CloudWatch)  
- **Infrastructure as Code** – Terraform (upcoming)  
- **DevSecOps Practices** – RBAC, secure configurations, authentication  
- **Linux & Scripting** – User management, processes, automation  

Each week focuses on one or more practical skill areas — including labs, notes, daily logs, and progress tracking.
