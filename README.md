# 🚀 Week 5 Recap – Kubernetes + IaC Foundations

Week 5 focused on:

- Completing the **Kubernetes for Absolute Beginners** course (100%)
- Installing **Minikube** as preparation for future Kubernetes hands-on
- Beginning **Terraform Basics** (providers, workflow, simple resources)
- Continuing AWS Cloud Practitioner modules (Module 4 completed during extended period)
- Updating repository documentation and summaries

> Week 5 included a few disruptions (birthday + sick day), so some progress spilled over into the early days of Week 6.  
> The core focus was completing Kubernetes theory and beginning Infrastructure as Code fundamentals.

---

# 🗓️ Week 6 – IaC Progress + AWS Practitioner Advancement

**Adjusted Week 6 Objective:**  
Strengthen Terraform fundamentals and continue AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials while preparing for full Kubernetes + Terraform hands-on work in Week 7.

### 🎯 **Goals (Revised Based on Actual Progress)**

- Strengthen Terraform basics:
  - Providers (`local_file`, `random_pet`)
  - Variables and outputs (completed)
  - Terraform workflow: `init`, `plan`, `apply`, `destroy`
- Install Terraform **locally** on Windows (completed)
- Continue AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials:
  - Completed Module 11 (Pricing & Support) — 90%
  - Remaining: Modules 8, 12, 13
- Maintain repo documentation and weekly logs
- Prepare environment for Week 7:
  - Terraform project folder structure
  - Minikube ready for hands-on work

> Note: Full Terraform + Minikube hands-on (Deployments, Services, YAML manifests, AWS IaC projects) has been moved to **Week 7**, as Week 6 focused on regaining momentum, completing AWS Module 11, and establishing a clean Terraform local setup.

---
# 🗓️ Week 7 – Kubernetes & Terraform Hands-On Restart

**Adjusted Week 7 Objective:**  
Rebuild momentum after a slow start to the week by performing small, focused hands-on exercises with Minikube and Terraform. The goal was to reinforce practical skills in Kubernetes resource creation and Terraform configuration basics while balancing job applications and personal commitments.

### 🎯 Goals (Realistic and Flexible for the Week)

- Re-establish consistent progress despite variable daily availability.
- Perform hands-on Kubernetes practice using Minikube:
  - Create Pod, Deployment, and Service manifests using `--dry-run=client -o yaml`
  - Deploy an application (Nginx), access it via NodePort, and clean up resources
- Begin structured Terraform hands-on practice:
  - Configure providers (`local`, `random`)
  - Use variables, outputs, and tfvars for overrides
  - Execute full Terraform workflow (`init`, `validate`, `plan`, `apply`, `destroy`)
- Organize new local practice folders for both Kubernetes and Terraform exercises
- Document progress and maintain repo updates through the week

> Week 7 included limited time on several days due to job applications and family responsibilities, but still resulted in meaningful progress in Minikube and Terraform hands-on practice.
