# 🗓️ Week 4 – Daily Log  
**Focus:** Kubernetes Intro & Orchestration  
**Duration:** Oct 29 – Nov 5, 2025  

---

### 📘 Day 1 (Oct 29, 2025)
- Officially started **Week 4 – Kubernetes Intro & Container Orchestration**.  
- Began the **KodeKloud “Kubernetes for Absolute Beginners”** course.  
- Completed approximately **25%** of the course.  
- Covered key concepts including:  
  - What Kubernetes is and why it’s used for orchestration  
  - The roles of **Pods**, **Nodes**, and **Control Plane Components** (API Server, Controller, Scheduler)  
  - How **Docker integrates with Kubernetes** to run and manage containers  
- Watched a demo on **Minikube installation**, but postponed setup as per course recommendation (to be done later in the course).  
- Found the structure and visuals very clear — this theory-first approach made understanding orchestration much easier.  
- **Next:** Continue to 50% completion, covering YAML basics and Pod creation labs.

### ☸️ Day 2 (Oct 30, 2025)
- Continued the **KodeKloud Kubernetes for Absolute Beginners** course.

  - **YAML Basics** and structure (`apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata`, `spec`)  
  - Creating **Pods using YAML manifests**  
  - Hands-on **labs** for creating and managing Pods.  
- Gained confidence reading and writing YAML syntax for Kubernetes object definitions.  
- Updated `k8s-lab-notes.md` with key syntax and examples.

### ⚙️ Day 3 (Oct 31, 2025)
- Continued the Kubernetes course to **53% completion**.  
- Covered **Replication Controllers** and **ReplicaSets**, including hands-on labs.  
- Started **Deployments** section — learned how they simplify management of multiple Pods and rolling updates.  
- Created and edited Deployment YAML files during labs.  
- Later in the day, switched to **AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials (Module 7 – Databases)** and completed **~25%**.  
- Decided to balance both learning tracks (Kubernetes + AWS) going forward.

### 🔐 Day 4 (Nov 1, 2025)
- Continued **AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials**.  
- Completed **Module 7 – Databases**, scoring **86%** in the quiz.  
- Reviewed key AWS database services: RDS, DynamoDB, Aurora, and Redshift.  
- Returned to **Module 2 – Compute in the Cloud**, which was previously at 50%.  
- Completed it fully, also scoring **86%** on the assessment quiz.  
- Feeling stronger with AWS fundamentals — compute, storage, and databases now all well understood.  
- Plan for next session: resume Kubernetes course, covering **Deployments** and **Services**.

### 💾 Day 5 (Nov 2 2025)
- Shifted focus back to **Linux Basics for DevOps** on KodeKloud.  
- Covered **Storage & Disk Partitioning** and **File Systems**.  
- Practiced creating and mounting file systems in the hands-on labs.  
- New commands practiced:  
  - `mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1` – format a partition with ext4  
  - `mkdir /mnt/ext4` – create a mount point  
  - `mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/ext4` – mount the device  
  - `sudo blkid /dev/vdd` – check UUID and filesystem type  
- Reached **89 %** course completion.

### 🧩 Day 6 (Nov 3 2025)
- Completed the remaining Linux Basics modules:  
  - **DAS (NAS vs SAN)** concepts  
  - **NFS file system** setup and **LVM (Logical Volume Management)** labs  
- Achieved **100 % completion** of the *Linux Basics for DevOps* course.  
- Earned the **KodeKloud Certificate of Completion** 🎓.  
- Reflected that the course’s “Bob and Project Mercury” storyline added great practical context to the learning.

### ☸️ Day 7 (Nov 4 2025)
- Returned to **Kubernetes for Absolute Beginners** (KodeKloud).  
- Progressed from **53 % → 60 %** completion.  
- Covered **Deployments – Updates and Rollbacks** with corresponding labs.  
- Practiced:  
  - Updating container images in Deployments  
  - Monitoring rollout status  
  - Performing rollbacks to previous revisions  
- Re-watched course guidance video confirming that **Minikube setup instructions** will be provided at the end — no need to install prematurely.  
- Plan: complete course through **Services, ConfigMaps, and Secrets** by Week 5 start.
