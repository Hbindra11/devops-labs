### 📘 Day 1 (Oct 29, 2025)
- Officially started **Week 4 – Kubernetes Intro & Container Orchestration**.  
- Began the **KodeKloud “Kubernetes for Absolute Beginners”** course.  
- Completed approximately **25%** of the course.  
- Covered key concepts including:  
  - What Kubernetes is and why it’s used for orchestration  
  - The roles of **Pods**, **Nodes**, and **Control Plane Components** (API Server, Controller, Scheduler)  
  - How **Docker integrates with Kubernetes** to run and manage containers  
- Watched a demo on **Minikube installation**, but postponed setup as per course recommendation (to be done later in the course).  
- Found the structure and visuals very clear — this theory-first approach made understanding orchestration much easier.  
- **Next:** Continue to 50% completion, covering YAML basics and Pod creation labs.
