# ☸️ Week 4 – Kubernetes Intro & Orchestration  

**Focus:** Understanding Kubernetes architecture and orchestration concepts before hands-on setup  
**Duration:** Week 4 of 8 (DevOps Foundations Practice Plan)  
**Date Range:** Oct 29 – Nov 5, 2025  

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals  

- Grasp the **core concepts of Kubernetes** — what it is, why it’s used, and how it manages containerized applications  
- Understand **Kubernetes architecture**: Pods, Nodes, Deployments, Services, and the Control Plane  
- Learn how Kubernetes builds upon Docker concepts (containers, images, networking)  
- Follow the **KodeKloud “Kubernetes for Absolute Beginners”** course to build a conceptual foundation  
- Prepare for upcoming **hands-on setup** with Minikube and kubectl  
- Continue parallel learning:  
  - **AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials** (Modules 11–12)  
  - **KodeKloud Docker for Absolute Beginners** (~50%)  
  - Complete **KodeKloud Linux Basics** (100%)

## 🧰 Tools & Learning Resources  

| Tool / Platform | Purpose |
|------------------|----------|
| **KodeKloud Kubernetes for Absolute Beginners** | Primary course for theory and guided labs |
| **Minikube (planned)** | Local single-node Kubernetes cluster for testing |
| **kubectl** | Command-line tool to interact with Kubernetes clusters |
| **Docker Desktop** | Underlying container runtime for local practice |
| **AWS Skill Builder** | Continuing Cloud Practitioner modules |
| **KodeKloud Docker & Linux Labs** | Reinforcing Docker and system administration fundamentals |

## 📘 Progress Summary  

I officially began Week 4 on **October 29, 2025**, starting with the **KodeKloud Kubernetes for Absolute Beginners** course.  
Following the recommended order, I completed **25% of the course**, focusing on foundational concepts before attempting a Minikube setup.  

### Key Concepts Covered So Far  
- What Kubernetes is and how it orchestrates containerized applications  
- The relationship between **Docker** and **Kubernetes**  
- **Pods** – smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes  
- **Nodes** – worker machines that run Pods  
- **Control Plane Components** – API Server, Scheduler, Controller Manager  
- The **Kubelet** and **kubectl** tools for managing workloads  
- Watched a demo on **Minikube installation** but postponed setup until later in the course, as recommended  

The structured explanations in KodeKloud made complex topics approachable and provided visual clarity on how container orchestration simplifies deployment and scaling.

## 🧠 Reflection  

This week marked the transition from single-container management (Docker) to **cluster-level orchestration** with Kubernetes.  
Starting with theory-first learning has given me a strong mental model for how the system works before touching configurations.  
Understanding how Kubernetes abstracts and manages containers is already helping me connect concepts from earlier Docker exercises to real-world DevOps workflows.

Parallel progress in AWS and Docker continues to reinforce the bigger DevOps picture — how cloud, containers, and automation all tie together.

## 🗓️ Next Steps  

- Continue the **KodeKloud Kubernetes for Absolute Beginners** course to **≥ 60% completion**  
- Set up **Minikube** and practice creating Pods and Deployments once setup lessons appear  
- Begin using **kubectl** commands and YAML manifests for configuration  
- Explore **Services** and how Kubernetes exposes applications  
- Continue **AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials** (Modules 11–12) and complete related labs  
- Advance **KodeKloud Docker for Absolute Beginners** to ~50% completion  
- Finish **Linux Basics** course and summarize key commands and concepts
